While lightweight\\nand training-free, these approaches depend entirely on the model’s existing abilities and\\noften yield limited or inconsistent improvements, particularly on complex tasks Li et al.\\n(2025b). Larger models, by contrast, exhibit significantly stronger reasoning abilities across\\na wide range of benchmarks (Muennighoff et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025; Plaat et al., 2024), but\\ntheir inference cost and latency make them impractical for many deployment scenarios. This\\ntension motivates a central question: Can we improve small reasoning models during inference\\nby selectively leveraging large models, without additional training?\\nInspired by speculative decoding (Leviathan et al., 2023), which accelerates generation\\nby using a small model to propose tokens later verified by a larger model, we propose<sep>Inspired by speculative decoding (Leviathan et al., 2023), which accelerates generation\\nby using a small model to propose tokens later verified by a larger model, we propose\\nSpeculative Thinking, a training-free framework for improving small-model reasoning\\nduring inference.

To further ana-\\nlyze them, we examine the preceding token distribution for reasoning-supportive tokens in\\nDeepseek-distilled Qwen-2.5-32B on the MATH500 dataset. As shown in Table 1, we report\\nthe top 10 most frequent preceding tokens for three representative reasoning-supportive\\ntokens: “wait”, “alternatively”, and “hmm”. Notably, for all three tokens, the preceding\\ntoken is overwhelmingly dominated by the newline symbol “\\\\n\\\\n“. For instance, in the\\n2Preprint.

The average output length of small models is\\nsignificantly higher than that of large models. This is primarily due to the excessive length\\nof incorrect responses. At its core, this phenomenon stems from inefficient and redundant\\nself-reflection in small models, which often leads to failed reasoning attempts and ultimately\\nprevents them from arriving at correct answers before its max output length.\\nSmall reasoning models have worse reasoning performances and much longer responses.\\nWe first report the accuracy and average output length for all three models.

As shown\\nin Figure 3, smaller models exhibit significantly lower accuracy compared to larger ones.\\nInterestingly, the average output length of smaller models tends to be much longer. As\\nmodel size increases, accuracy improves while outputs become more concise. To further\\nunderstand this phenomenon, we analyze the average lengths of correct and incorrect\\nresponses separately. We find that, across all model sizes, incorrect responses are consistently\\nmuch longer than correct ones. This suggests that the overall average output length is\\nheavily influenced by the proportion of incorrect answers, which are typically more verbose.\\nLarger-scale models exhibit more effective self-reflection and backtracking during reason-\\ning.

As shown in Figure 3,\\nsuch phrases occur far more frequently in incorrect responses, particularly in smaller models.\\nThis suggests that smaller models tend to over-reflect yet under-reason, leading to inefficient\\nexploration of the solution space. Consequently, the excessive length of their outputs is\\nprimarily due to their inability to converge on correct answers within the maximum context\\nwindow, resulting in repetitive branching and redundant verification steps.\\n2.3 How to Combine Small and Large Reasoning Model?\\nWe observe that when reasoning models generate incorrect answers, their average output<sep>2.3 How to Combine Small and Large Reasoning Model?\\nWe observe that when reasoning models generate incorrect answers, their average output\\nlength increases significantly.

This naturally raises an intriguing question: Can the reasoning ability of\\nlarger models be leveraged to monitor smaller models during inference?\\nWe propose a novel intervention strategy that utilizes the \"\\\\n\\\\n\" reasoning pattern as a\\ncontrol point for collaborative inference.

Speculative\\nmodel performs primary reasoning, while target model intervenes selectively to provide\\nauxiliary thoughts when necessary. The overall framework is in Figure 4, .

This mechanism leverages stronger reasoning ability\\nof target model to help speculative model decide whether to continue or revise. Speculative\\nmodel first generates responses until a delimiter token (e.g., \\\\n\\\\n) is encountered. After this\\ndelimiter, speculative model generates one full sentence (i.e., n1 tokens).

Whenever a\\n\\\\n\\\\n delimiter is encountered—regardless of whether the subsequent sentence is generated\\nby the speculative or target model—we examine if the sentence contains verification-related\\ncues (e.g., verify, double-check, etc.). If such cues are detected, target model takes over to\\ngenerate n2 tokens, assisting the verification process and mitigating false conclusions.\\n(3) Excessive Reflection Takeover.

The rationale\\nfor choosing the estimated inference speed, along with the details of its computation, is\\nprovided at the end of this section. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets:\\nAIME 2022–2024, GPQA-Diamond, MATH500, and AMC23.\\nAnalysis of results of Large Reasoning Models Monitor Small Reasoning Models.

In addition, we further enhance the speculative model by allowing target model to\\ngenerate the first 100 tokens before any question answering begins.

Current approaches to enhancing the reasoning capabilities (Chen et al.,\\n2025a; Plaat et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2023) of language models primarily fall into two categories:\\nreinforcement learning (Schulman et al., 2017) and supervised fine-tuning (Jaech et al., 2024;\\nYang et al., 2024). For instance, DeepSeek (Guo et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024) achieved\\nstate-of-the-art reasoning performance using GRPO (Shao et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2025), and\\nfurther improved smaller models by distilling high-quality reasoning traces.

This line of\\nresearch has inspired numerous efforts to replicate DeepSeek-R1 with the goal of uncovering\\npotential “aha moments” in reasoning, including works such as Logic RL (Xie et al., 2025)\\nand SimpleRL-Zoo (Zeng et al., 2025). Many studies also use SFT to improve reasoning,\\nincluding SkyThought-T1 (Team, 2025b) and Bespoke-Stratos-32B (Labs, 2025), which collect\\nand fine-tune on carefully curated high-quality reasoning data. Several works have further\\ninvestigated key techniques for enhancing reasoning performance during RL (Baek &\\nTegmark, 2025; Yeo et al., 2025) or SFT (Chen et al., 2025b; 2024a; Tian et al., 2025; Liu et al.,\\n2025b).

For example, (Li et al., 2025a) argues that the structure of reasoning steps in the\\ndata is more critical than the actual content; (Ji et al., 2025) highlights the importance of the\\ninitial few tokens in each reasoning instance for optimizing model performance. In addition,\\nseveral recent studies—such as s1(Muennighoff et al., 2025) emphasize the value of selecting\\na small set of high-quality reasoning samples to drive efficient model improvement.\\nEfficient Reasoning. Current reasoning models still exhibit notable limitations (Bandyopad-\\nhyay et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025c). One prominent issue is excessive response length—many\\nreasoning-enabled models tend to generate unnecessarily verbose outputs. As a result, effi-\\ncient reasoning has become an emerging research focus.

An early effort in this direction was\\nproposed by Kimi 1.5 (Team et al., 2025), which introduced the Long-to-Short method. This\\napproach collects paired long and short responses and applies Direct Preference Optimiza-\\ntion (Rafailov et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2024) to train models that prefer concise answers. The\\nidea was later reproduced by Sky-Thought (Team, 2025a), further validating its effectiveness.\\nTokenSkip (Xia et al., 2025), which improves efficiency by identifying and removing redun-\\ndant or uninformative tokens to create cleaner training data. LightThinker (Zhang et al.,\\n2025) takes a different route by explicitly compressing intermediate thoughts to generate\\nshorter yet informative reasoning traces, thereby enabling models to produce more concise\\noutputs via fine-tuning.

Wang et al. (2025); Sui et al. (2025a) highlights a counterintuitive\\nphenomenon: when reasoning fails, model outputs often become significantly longer. This is\\nattributed to repetitive generation of reasoning-supportive tokens like “wait”, which reflect\\nthe model’s tendency to over-compensate by generating more thoughts. Other notable\\napproaches include Dynasor(Fu et al., 2024), which uses probing techniques to detect and\\nterminate reasoning early. There are some other works including efficient reaosning (Aytes\\net al., 2025; Lee et al., 2025; Sui et al., 2025c; Xu et al., 2025; Liao et al., 2025).\\n6 Conclusion\\nWe propose Speculative Thinking, a training-free framework that leverages larger reasoning\\nmodels to guide smaller ones through selective delegation at structurally meaningful points<sep>6 Conclusion\\nWe propose Speculative Thinking, a training-free framework that leverages larger reasoning\\nmodels to guide smaller ones through selective delegation at structurally meaningful points\\nin generation.

      "This is a preprint under review. The paper introduces Speculative Thinking, a training-free framework to enhance reasoning in small language models by using larger models for guidance during inference. It focuses on the reasoning level, unlike speculative decoding, which operates at the token level. The authors are Wang Yang, Xiang Yue, Vipin Chaudhary, and Xiaotian Han, affiliated with Case Western Reserve University and Carnegie Mellon University.\n",
      "The paper's abstract explains that existing methods often require costly training and produce inefficient outputs. Speculative Thinking uses large reasoning models to guide smaller ones during inference. This is achieved by observing that reasoning-supportive tokens like \"wait\" often follow structural delimiters like \"\\n\\n\". Larger models exhibit better control over reflective behavior. The method boosts reasoning accuracy in smaller models and shortens their outputs. For example, the 1.5B model's accuracy on MATH500 increases from 83.2% to 89.4% with the help of a 32B model. The average output length decreased by 15.7%. The framework also improves non-reasoning models, such as Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, on the same benchmark.\n",
      "The provided results demonstrate the effectiveness of Speculative Thinking. On the AIME dataset, the accuracy improvement for the 1.5B model was +6.7% with a -11.8% decrease in average output length. On the MATH500 dataset, the 1.5B model's accuracy increased by +6.2% with a -15.7% decrease in length. The GPQA dataset saw an +8.1% increase in accuracy and a -4.0% decrease in length. The AMC23 dataset showed a +5.0% increase in accuracy and a -16.9% decrease in average output length.\n",
      "Figure 1 illustrates that Speculative Thinking significantly improves the reasoning accuracy of the 1.5B model while reducing the average output length. The figure compares the accuracy and output length of models on four datasets: AIME 2020–2024, MATH500, GPQA, and AMC23. The Deepseek-Distilled Qwen 2.5-1.5B model is referred to as \"1.5B,\" the Deepseek-Distilled Qwen 2.5-32B model is referred to as \"32B,\" and the proposed Speculative Thinking method (where the 32B model supervises the 1.5B model's reflective reasoning steps) is represented as \"1.5B+32B.\" The code is available at https://github.com/uservan/speculative_thinking.\n",
      "This is a preprint under review. The paper is titled \"Speculative Thinking: Enhancing Small-Model Reasoning with Large Model Guidance at Inference Time.\" The introduction discusses the widespread use of smaller language models in real-world applications due to their lower computational and memory requirements. These models often underperform on complex reasoning tasks. Current methods to improve them, such as supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, can be costly and difficult to scale.\n",
      "The introduction continues by mentioning that inference-time scaling methods have been proposed to improve small models without retraining. However, these methods often yield limited improvements, especially on complex tasks. Larger models have stronger reasoning abilities but are impractical for many deployment scenarios due to inference cost and latency. The central question is whether small models can be improved during inference by selectively using large models, without retraining.\n",
      "Inspired by speculative decoding (Leviathan et al., 2023), the paper proposes Speculative Thinking, a training-free framework to improve small-model reasoning during inference. Unlike speculative decoding, which operates at the token level, this approach focuses on the reasoning level. A small model generates most of the output but delegates difficult reasoning segments to a stronger model. These segments are identified through structural cues, like paragraph breaks (\"\\n\\n\") followed by reflective phrases, such as \"wait\" and \"alternatively.\"\n",
      "The Speculative Thinking framework aims to preserve the small model's efficiency while leveraging the large model's strength. Empirical results show that a 1.5B model, assisted by Deepseek-distilled Qwen-2.5-32B, improved by +6.6% on AIME, +6.2% on MATH500 (Lightman et al., 2023), +8.1% on GPQA (Rein et al., 2024), and +5.0% on AMC23, while reducing output length. This approach is also effective for non-reasoning models. Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct gained +7.8% on MATH500 and +14.2% on GPQA when assisted by the 32B mentor.\n",
      "In summary, Speculative Thinking offers a new inference-time paradigm that combines the efficiency of small models with the reasoning strength of large models, potentially leading to cost-effective reasoning augmentation.\n",
      "The paper's second section is titled \"2 Motivations.\" It discusses the analysis of LLM reasoning processes. Reasoning models often generate reasoning-supportive tokens like \"wait,\" \"hmm,\" and \"alternatively,\" which are related to self-reflection behavior. The authors analyzed the preceding tokens for these reasoning-supportive tokens in the Deepseek-distilled Qwen-2.5-32B model on the MATH500 dataset.\n",
      "The analysis of reasoning-supportive tokens shows that \"wait\", \"alternatively\", and \"hmm\" are frequently preceded by structural delimiters such as \"\\n\\n\". For instance, in the case of \"wait\", over 80% of its preceding tokens are \"\\n\\n\". This suggests that \"\\n\\n\" acts as a thinking cue, prompting the model to reflect or continue reasoning. The same analysis was extended to other models on the MATH500 dataset in Appendix A.4.\n",
      "The authors conducted a case study on responses generated by Deepseek-distilled Qwen-2.5-1.5B and Qwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct to further prove the role of \"\\n\\n\". The study segmented the model's output into Affirmation, Reflection, and Statement based on the presence of specific keywords. The authors found that sentences following \"\\n\\n\" often contain reasoning-related cues, suggesting that \"\\n\\n\" is a discourse marker.\n",
      "The second part of the \"2 Motivations\" section addresses comparisons between small and large reasoning models. The authors compared reasoning models of different sizes, including Deepseek-distilled Qwen-2.5-32B, 7B, and 1.5B, focusing on accuracy and output length on the AIME 2022-2024 dataset. The results are shown in Figure 3, and detailed statistics on other datasets can be found in Appendix A.5.\n",
      "The conclusion from the comparison of models of different sizes is that small reasoning models have worse reasoning performance and much longer responses. The authors reported accuracy and average output length for the three models. Smaller models have significantly lower accuracy, while their average output length tends to be much longer. As model size increases, accuracy improves, and outputs become more concise. The average length of incorrect responses is consistently longer than correct ones.\n",
      "The analysis concludes that larger-scale models exhibit more effective self-reflection and backtracking during reasoning. The authors analyzed the frequency of reflective phrases, such as \"wait\" and \"alternatively,\" which indicate hesitation, self-reflection, or backtracking in the reasoning process. These phrases occur more frequently in incorrect responses, particularly in smaller models. This suggests that smaller models tend to over-reflect, leading to inefficient exploration of the solution space.\n",
      "The third section of the \"2 Motivations\" section asks, \"2.3 How to Combine Small and Large Reasoning Model?\" The authors observe that when reasoning models generate incorrect answers, their average output length increases significantly, often accompanied by excessive use of words like \"wait.\" The question is whether the reasoning ability of larger models can be leveraged to monitor smaller models during inference.\n",
      "The paper proposes a novel intervention strategy that utilizes the \"\\n\\n\" reasoning pattern as a control point for collaborative inference. When a smaller model encounters \"\\n\\n\" followed by tokens like \"wait,\" the authors suggest delegating the subsequent reasoning step to a larger model. The larger model would then generate the next thought segment, acting as a reasoning supervisor or corrector. This large-model-aided intervention may enhance the robustness and accuracy of smaller models by injecting stronger reasoning capabilities.\n",
      "The third section of the paper is titled \"3 Method: Speculative Thinking.\" The authors propose a collaborative inference framework called Speculative Thinking, where a small model acts as the speculative model and a large model serves as the target model. The speculative model performs primary reasoning, while the target model intervenes selectively. The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 4. The hyper-parameters for Speculative Thinking are shown in Appendix A.2.\n",
      "The target model takes over the speculative model's generation under three scenarios: (1) Affirmation/Reflection Takeover. This mechanism uses the target model to decide whether to continue or revise. (2) Verification Takeover. This intervention is triggered when a \\n\\n delimiter is encountered, and the sentence contains verification cues. (3) Excessive Reflection Takeover. This intervention is implemented using a negativity counter that tracks the number of reflection sentences.\n",
      "Table 2 shows the accuracy, average output length, and estimated speed of models on four datasets. The 1.5B model refers to the Deepseek-Distilled Qwen-2.5-1.5B model. \"+\" means with the help of large models. Modify ratio indicates the proportion of tokens in the final output that come from the target model. After applying Speculative Thinking, both 1.5B and 7B models improved in accuracy, output length, and estimated inference speed.\n",
      "The results in Table 2 show the performance improvements with Speculative Thinking. The 1.5B model saw improvements in accuracy, and output length, and estimated inference speed. The 7B model also saw improvements in accuracy, output length, and estimated inference speed.\n",
      "The fourth section, \"4 Experiments,\" focuses on the evaluation of Speculative Thinking. The authors adopted three key evaluation metrics: accuracy, average output length, and estimated inference speed. The rationale for choosing the estimated inference speed and the details of its computation are provided at the end of this section. Experiments were conducted on four benchmark datasets: AIME 2022–2024, GPQA-Diamond, MATH500, and AMC23.\n",
      "The section titled \"4.1 Large Reasoning Models Monitor Small Reasoning Models\" analyzes the results. The results are summarized in Table 2, demonstrating that the method consistently improves accuracy, reduces output length, and enhances inference speed. For example, after being assisted by the 32B target model, the 1.5B speculative model demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across multiple datasets.\n",
      "The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Speculative Thinking. The 1.5B model's accuracy increased by 6.2% on MATH500, 8.1% on GPQA, 5.0% on AMC23, and 6.6% on AIME. In addition, the average output length decreased by 15.7%, 3.9%, 16.9%, and 11.7% on the same datasets, respectively. The 1.5B model assisted by the 32B model consistently outperforms the standalone 32B model in terms of generation speed. The target model only needs to modify approximately 20% of the speculative model’s output to significantly enhance its reasoning performance.\n",
      "Figure 5 shows a comparison between the prefix and decode stages, revealing that the time required to process multiple tokens during the prefix phase is nearly equivalent to the time taken to decode a single token.\n",
      "The paper provides a \"Theoretical Estimation of FLOPs and Token Generation Speed.\" The authors used a theoretical analysis instead of empirical timing because Speculative Thinking introduces logical coordination between models. Runtime measurements would be significantly affected by backend GPU optimizations, especially in systems like vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023). The computation of FLOPs for prefill and decode stages is in Appendix A.1.\n",
      "The average inference time for both decode and prefix stages was empirically profiled across various model sizes and output token lengths. These measurements were obtained using the generate() API from HuggingFace Transformers, with key-value cache enabled for the prompt. The authors observed that the average time in the prefix stage remains relatively stable across positions when GPU memory is sufficient. To reflect the difference, a speedup for the prefix stage was assumed: FLOPsprefix(m) = FLOPsdecode(n = 1), where m and n mean the token number. The GPU computational capacity was set to 3.12 × 1010 FLOPs/s, which corresponds to an A100-class GPU. The estimated speed is calculated as follows: Estimated Speed = Total Tokens / (FLOPsprefill + FLOPsprefix + FLOPsdecode) / GPU Capacity (1).\n",
      "The section titled \"4.2 Reasoning Models Monitor Non-Reasoning Models\" asks if reasoning-capable models can enhance the performance and accuracy of non-reasoning models. The Speculative Thinking framework was adapted to monitor a speculative model that lacks inherent reasoning capability.\n",
      "The modifications for speculative thinking applied to non-reasoning models are explained. In Affirmation/Reflection Takeover, the target model directly generates the next sentence after each \"\\n\\n.\" The target model generates the first 100 tokens before any question answering begins.\n",
      "The results of Reasoning Models Monitoring Non-Reasoning Models are analyzed. The results are shown in Table 3. Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, a non-reasoning model, benefits notably from speculative assistance by both 7B and 32B reasoning models. For instance, on the MATH500 dataset, its accuracy improves from 74.0% to 81.8%. However, this came at the cost of increased output length.\n",
      "The results of the experiment with non-reasoning models also showed that when assisted by the 1.5B reasoning model, performance improvements are not consistently observed. The authors state that it is preferable to choose a target model that is either of equal size or larger than the speculative model, and more importantly, possesses stronger reasoning capabilities. Mismatches where the speculative model is larger or stronger than the target model may lead to suboptimal or even detrimental outcomes.\n",
      "Section 4.3 is titled \"Comparisons between Speculative Decoding and Speculative Thinking.\" Figure 6 compares speculative decoding and speculative thinking using a 7B speculative model and a 32B target model. In Speculative Decoding, the speculative model generates 20 tokens per step to match the number of intervention tokens in Speculative Thinking.\n",
      "The experiment compares speculative decoding and speculative thinking. Speculative decoding relies on the speculative and target models having similar token output distributions to accelerate generation. Speculative Thinking focuses on enhancing the speculative model’s reasoning with lightweight assistance from the target model, without strictly requiring token distributional alignment.\n",
      "Figure 6 shows that speculative decoding, although matching the accuracy of the 32B model, often suffers from a high rejection rate, which diminishes its speed. Speculative Thinking avoids this issue by allowing the target model to intervene only when necessary, improving the speculative model’s reasoning with minimal overhead.\n",
      "The fifth section, \"5 Related Works,\" discusses related research. The section on LLM Reasoning notes that current approaches to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models primarily fall into reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. For instance, DeepSeek (Guo et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024) achieved state-of-the-art reasoning performance using GRPO (Shao et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2025), and further improved smaller models by distilling high-quality reasoning traces.\n",
      "The related work section continues by highlighting the inspiration from DeepSeek-R1 and efforts to replicate it, including works such as Logic RL (Xie et al., 2025) and SimpleRL-Zoo (Zeng et al., 2025). Many studies also use SFT to improve reasoning, including SkyThought-T1 (Team, 2025b) and Bespoke-Stratos-32B (Labs, 2025). Several works have further investigated key techniques for enhancing reasoning performance during RL (Baek & Tegmark, 2025; Yeo et al., 2025) or SFT (Chen et al., 2025b; 2024a; Tian et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025b).\n",
      "The related works section continues by citing that (Li et al., 2025a) argues that the structure of reasoning steps in the data is more critical than the actual content. (Ji et al., 2025) highlights the importance of the initial few tokens in each reasoning instance for optimizing model performance. In addition, several recent studies—such as s1(Muennighoff et al., 2025) emphasize the value of selecting a small set of high-quality reasoning samples to drive efficient model improvement.\n",
      "The related works section also discusses efficient reasoning. Current reasoning models still exhibit notable limitations (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025c). One prominent issue is excessive response length. Efficient reasoning has become an emerging research focus.\n",
      "An early effort in efficient reasoning was proposed by Kimi 1.5 (Team et al., 2025), which introduced the Long-to-Short method. The idea was later reproduced by Sky-Thought (Team, 2025a). TokenSkip (Xia et al., 2025) improves efficiency by identifying and removing redundant tokens. LightThinker (Zhang et al., 2025) explicitly compresses intermediate thoughts to generate shorter reasoning traces. Wang et al. (2025); Sui et al. (2025a) highlight a counterintuitive phenomenon: when reasoning fails, model outputs often become significantly longer.\n",
      "Other notable approaches include Dynasor(Fu et al., 2024). There are some other works including efficient reaosning (Aytes et al., 2025; Lee et al., 2025; Sui et al., 2025c; Xu et al., 2025; Liao et al., 2025).\n",
      "The sixth section is \"6 Conclusion.\" The authors propose Speculative Thinking, a training-free framework that leverages larger reasoning models to guide smaller ones through selective delegation at structurally meaningful points in generation. The approach significantly enhances both accuracy, average output length and efficiency without any additional training in four math reasoning datasets like MATH500. Experiments demonstrate substantial gains in performance and output conciseness.\n",
      "The conclusion continues by stating that the framework highlights a promising paradigm for improving reasoning of reasoning and non-reasoning models without additional data or training computation cost.\n",
      "The paper's section on \"Limitations\" states that Speculative Thinking relies on a larger target model to improve the reasoning ability and reduce the output length of a smaller speculative model. For the framework to be effective, the target model must possess stronger reasoning capabilities than the speculative model. The current implementation assumes that both models belong to the same model family, which allows the authors to leverage shared KV cache structures to accelerate inference.\n",
      "The limitations section continues by stating that the performance of Speculative Thinking is sensitive to prompt quality—utilizing an optimized prompt for each model is critical to achieving the best results, like “Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.”.\n",

This\\napproach collects paired long and short responses and applies Direct Preference Optimiza-\\ntion (Rafailov et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2024) to train models that prefer concise answers. The\\nidea was later reproduced by Sky-Thought (Team, 2025a), further validating its effectiveness.\\nTokenSkip (Xia et al., 2025), which improves efficiency by identifying and removing redun-\\ndant or uninformative tokens to create cleaner training data. LightThinker (Zhang et al.,\\n2025) takes a different route by explicitly compressing intermediate thoughts to generate\\nshorter yet informative reasoning traces, thereby enabling models to produce more concise\\noutputs via fine-tuning.

       " 'shorter yet informative reasoning traces, thereby enabling models to produce more concise\\noutputs via fine-tuning. Wang et al. (2025); Sui et al. (2025a) highlights a counterintuitive\\nphenomenon: when reasoning fails, model outputs often become significantly longer. This is\\nattributed to repetitive generation of reasoning-supportive tokens like “wait”, which reflect\\nthe model’s tendency to over-compensate by generating more thoughts. Other notable\\napproaches include Dynasor(Fu et al., 2024), which uses probing techniques to detect and\\nterminate reasoning early. There are some other works including efficient reaosning (Aytes\\net al., 2025; Lee et al., 2025; Sui et al., 2025c; Xu et al., 2025; Liao et al., 2025).\\n6 Conclusion\\nWe propose Speculative Thinking, a training-free framework that leverages larger reasoning\\nmodels to guide smaller ones through selective delegation at structurally meaningful points',\n",
       " '6 Conclusion\\nWe propose Speculative Thinking, a training-free framework that leverages larger reasoning\\nmodels to guide smaller ones through selective delegation at structurally meaningful points\\nin generation. By exploiting the natural reasoning patterns of LLMs—particularly reflec-\\ntion cues like \"\\\\n\\\\n\"—our approach significantly enhances both accuracy, average output\\nlength and efficiency without any additional training in four math reasoning datasets like\\nMATH500. Experiments demonstrate substantial gains in performance and output con-\\nciseness, underscoring the potential of collaborative inference between models of different\\ncapacities. This highlights a promising paradigm for improving reasoning of reasoning and\\nnon-reasoning models without additional data or training computation cost.\\n9Preprint.

       " '9Preprint. Under review.\\nLimitations\\nSpeculative Thinking relies on the assistance of a larger target model to improve the reason-\\ning ability and reduce the output length of a smaller speculative model. For this framework\\nto be effective, target model must possess stronger reasoning capabilities than speculative\\nmodel. Additionally, our current implementation assumes that both models belong to the\\nsame model family, which allows us to leverage shared KV cache structures to accelerate\\ninference. Finally, we observe that the performance of Speculative Thinking is sensitive\\nto prompt quality—utilizing an optimized prompt for each model is critical to achieving\\nthe best results, like “Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within\\n\\\\boxed{}.”.\\nReferences\\nSimon A Aytes, Jinheon Baek, and Sung Ju Hwang.

The paper introduces Speculative Thinking, a training-free framework to enhance reasoning in small language models by using larger models for guidance during inference. It focuses on the reasoning level, unlike speculative decoding, which operates at the token level.

       " 'The paper\\'s abstract explains that existing methods often require costly training and produce inefficient outputs. Speculative Thinking uses large reasoning models to guide smaller ones during inference. This is achieved by observing that reasoning-supportive tokens like \"wait\" often follow structural delimiters like \"\\\\n\\\\n\". Larger models exhibit better control over reflective behavior. The method boosts reasoning accuracy in smaller models and shortens their outputs. For example, the 1.5B model\\'s accuracy on MATH500 increases from 83.2% to 89.4% with the help of a 32B model. The average output length decreased by 15.7%. The framework also improves non-reasoning models, such as Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, on the same benchmark.',\n",

The figure compares the accuracy and output length of models on four datasets: AIME 2020–2024, MATH500, GPQA, and AMC23. The Deepseek-Distilled Qwen 2.5-1.5B model is referred to as \"1.5B,\" the Deepseek-Distilled Qwen 2.5-32B model is referred to as \"32B,\" and the proposed Speculative Thinking method (where the 32B model supervises the 1.5B model\\'s reflective reasoning steps) is represented as \"1.5B+32B.\" The code is available at https://github.com/uservan/speculative_thinking.',\n",
       " 'This is a preprint under review. The paper is titled \"Speculative Thinking: Enhancing Small-Model Reasoning with Large Model Guidance at Inference Time.\" The introduction discusses the widespread use of smaller language models in real-world applications due to their lower computational and memory requirements. These models often underperform on complex reasoning tasks. Current methods to improve them, such as supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, can be costly and difficult to scale.',\n",
       " 'The introduction continues by mentioning that inference-time scaling methods have been proposed to improve small models without retraining. However, these methods often yield limited improvements, especially on complex tasks. Larger models have stronger reasoning abilities but are impractical for many deployment scenarios due to inference cost and latency. The central question is whether small models can be improved during inference by selectively using large models, without retraining.',\n",
       " 'Inspired by speculative decoding (Leviathan et al., 2023), the paper proposes Speculative Thinking, a training-free framework to improve small-model reasoning during inference. Unlike speculative decoding, which operates at the token level, this approach focuses on the reasoning level. A small model generates most of the output but delegates difficult reasoning segments to a stronger model. These segments are identified through structural cues, like paragraph breaks (\"\\\\n\\\\n\") followed by reflective phrases, such as \"wait\" and \"alternatively.\"',\n",
       " \"The Speculative Thinking framework aims to preserve the small model's efficiency while leveraging the large model's strength. Empirical results show that a 1.5B model, assisted by Deepseek-distilled Qwen-2.5-32B, improved by +6.6% on AIME, +6.2% on MATH500 (Lightman et al., 2023), +8.1% on GPQA (Rein et al., 2024), and +5.0% on AMC23, while reducing output length. This approach is also effective for non-reasoning models. Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct gained +7.8% on MATH500 and +14.2% on GPQA when assisted by the 32B mentor.\",\n",
       " 'In summary, Speculative Thinking offers a new inference-time paradigm that combines the efficiency of small models with the reasoning strength of large models, potentially leading to cost-effective reasoning augmentation.',\n",
       " 'The paper\\'s second section is titled \"2 Motivations.\" It discusses the analysis of LLM reasoning processes. Reasoning models often generate reasoning-supportive tokens like \"wait,\" \"hmm,\" and \"alternatively,\" which are related to self-reflection behavior. The authors analyzed the preceding tokens for these reasoning-supportive tokens in the Deepseek-distilled Qwen-2.5-32B model on the MATH500 dataset.',\n",
       " 'The analysis of reasoning-supportive tokens shows that \"wait\", \"alternatively\", and \"hmm\" are frequently preceded by structural delimiters such as \"\\\\n\\\\n\". For instance, in the case of \"wait\", over 80% of its preceding tokens are \"\\\\n\\\\n\". This suggests that \"\\\\n\\\\n\" acts as a thinking cue, prompting the model to reflect or continue reasoning. The same analysis was extended to other models on the MATH500 dataset in Appendix A.4.',\n",
       " 'The authors conducted a case study on responses generated by Deepseek-distilled Qwen-2.5-1.5B and Qwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct to further prove the role of \"\\\\n\\\\n\". The study segmented the model\\'s output into Affirmation, Reflection, and Statement based on the presence of specific keywords. The authors found that sentences following \"\\\\n\\\\n\" often contain reasoning-related cues, suggesting that \"\\\\n\\\\n\" is a discourse marker.',\n",
       " 'The second part of the \"2 Motivations\" section addresses comparisons between small and large reasoning models. The authors compared reasoning models of different sizes, including Deepseek-distilled Qwen-2.5-32B, 7B, and 1.5B, focusing on accuracy and output length on the AIME 2022-2024 dataset. The results are shown in Figure 3, and detailed statistics on other datasets can be found in Appendix A.5.',\n",
       " 'The conclusion from the comparison of models of different sizes is that small reasoning models have worse reasoning performance and much longer responses. The authors reported accuracy and average output length for the three models. Smaller models have significantly lower accuracy, while their average output length tends to be much longer. As model size increases, accuracy improves, and outputs become more concise. The average length of incorrect responses is consistently longer than correct ones.',\n",
       " 'The analysis concludes that larger-scale models exhibit more effective self-reflection and backtracking during reasoning. The authors analyzed the frequency of reflective phrases, such as \"wait\" and \"alternatively,\" which indicate hesitation, self-reflection, or backtracking in the reasoning process. These phrases occur more frequently in incorrect responses, particularly in smaller models. This suggests that smaller models tend to over-reflect, leading to inefficient exploration of the solution space.',\n",
       " 'The third section of the \"2 Motivations\" section asks, \"2.3 How to Combine Small and Large Reasoning Model?\" The authors observe that when reasoning models generate incorrect answers, their average output length increases significantly, often accompanied by excessive use of words like \"wait.\" The question is whether the reasoning ability of larger models can be leveraged to monitor smaller models during inference.',\n",
       " 'The paper proposes a novel intervention strategy that utilizes the \"\\\\n\\\\n\" reasoning pattern as a control point for collaborative inference. When a smaller model encounters \"\\\\n\\\\n\" followed by tokens like \"wait,\" the authors suggest delegating the subsequent reasoning step to a larger model. The larger model would then generate the next thought segment, acting as a reasoning supervisor or corrector. This large-model-aided intervention may enhance the robustness and accuracy of smaller models by injecting stronger reasoning capabilities.',\n",
       " 'The third section of the paper is titled \"3 Method: Speculative Thinking.\" The authors propose a collaborative inference framework called Speculative Thinking, where a small model acts as the speculative model and a large model serves as the target model. The speculative model performs primary reasoning, while the target model intervenes selectively. The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 4. The hyper-parameters for Speculative Thinking are shown in Appendix A.2.',\n",
       " \"The target model takes over the speculative model's generation under three scenarios: (1) Affirmation/Reflection Takeover. This mechanism uses the target model to decide whether to continue or revise. (2) Verification Takeover. This intervention is triggered when a \\\\n\\\\n delimiter is encountered, and the sentence contains verification cues. (3) Excessive Reflection Takeover. This intervention is implemented using a negativity counter that tracks the number of reflection sentences.\",\n",

The results are summarized in Table 2, demonstrating that the method consistently improves accuracy, reduces output length, and enhances inference speed. For example, after being assisted by the 32B target model, the 1.5B speculative model demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across multiple datasets.',\n",
       " \"The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Speculative Thinking. The 1.5B model's accuracy increased by 6.2% on MATH500, 8.1% on GPQA, 5.0% on AMC23, and 6.6% on AIME. In addition, the average output length decreased by 15.7%, 3.9%, 16.9%, and 11.7% on the same datasets, respectively. The 1.5B model assisted by the 32B model consistently outperforms the standalone 32B model in terms of generation speed. The target model only needs to modify approximately 20% of the speculative model’s output to significantly enhance its reasoning performance.\",\n",
       " 'Figure 5 shows a comparison between the prefix and decode stages, revealing that the time required to process multiple tokens during the prefix phase is nearly equivalent to the time taken to decode a single token.',\n",

Runtime measurements would be significantly affected by backend GPU optimizations, especially in systems like vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023). The computation of FLOPs for prefill and decode stages is in Appendix A.1.',\n",

These measurements were obtained using the generate() API from HuggingFace Transformers, with key-value cache enabled for the prompt. The authors observed that the average time in the prefix stage remains relatively stable across positions when GPU memory is sufficient. To reflect the difference, a speedup for the prefix stage was assumed: FLOPsprefix(m) = FLOPsdecode(n = 1), where m and n mean the token number. The GPU computational capacity was set to 3.12 × 1010 FLOPs/s, which corresponds to an A100-class GPU. The estimated speed is calculated as follows: Estimated Speed = Total Tokens / (FLOPsprefill + FLOPsprefix + FLOPsdecode) / GPU Capacity (1).',\n",

      "{'question': \"What is the main contribution of the paper 'Speculative Thinking'?\", 'ground_truth': ['It introduces a training-free framework to enhance reasoning in small language models by using larger models for guidance during inference.'], 'contexts': ['Small reasoning models have worse reasoning performances and much longer responses.\\nWe first report the accuracy and average output length for all three models. As shown\\nin Figure 3, smaller models exhibit significantly lower accuracy compared to larger ones.\\nInterestingly, the average output length of smaller models tends to be much longer. As\\nmodel size increases, accuracy improves while outputs become more concise. To further\\nunderstand this phenomenon, we analyze the average lengths of correct and incorrect\\nresponses separately. We find that, across all model sizes, incorrect responses are consistently\\nmuch longer than correct ones. This suggests that the overall average output length is\\nheavily influenced by the proportion of incorrect answers, which are typically more verbose.\\nLarger-scale models exhibit more effective self-reflection and backtracking during reason-\\ning. To further investigate why incorrect responses are substantially longer than correct ones,. Document Meaning : The third section of the paper is titled \"3 Method: Speculative Thinking.\" The authors propose a collaborative inference framework called Speculative Thinking, where a small model acts as the speculative model and a large model serves as the target model. The speculative model performs primary reasoning, while the target model intervenes selectively. The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 4. The hyper-parameters for Speculative Thinking are shown in Appendix A.2.', 'shorter yet informative reasoning traces, thereby enabling models to produce more concise\\noutputs via fine-tuning. Wang et al. (2025); Sui et al. (2025a) highlights a counterintuitive\\nphenomenon: when reasoning fails, model outputs often become significantly longer. This is\\nattributed to repetitive generation of reasoning-supportive tokens like “wait”, which reflect\\nthe model’s tendency to over-compensate by generating more thoughts. Other notable\\napproaches include Dynasor(Fu et al., 2024), which uses probing techniques to detect and\\nterminate reasoning early. There are some other works including efficient reaosning (Aytes\\net al., 2025; Lee et al., 2025; Sui et al., 2025c; Xu et al., 2025; Liao et al., 2025).\\n6 Conclusion\\nWe propose Speculative Thinking, a training-free framework that leverages larger reasoning\\nmodels to guide smaller ones through selective delegation at structurally meaningful points. Document Meaning : The paper\\'s section on \"Limitations\" states that Speculative Thinking relies on a larger target model to improve the reasoning ability and reduce the output length of a smaller speculative model. For the framework to be effective, the target model must possess stronger reasoning capabilities than the speculative model. The current implementation assumes that both models belong to the same model family, which allows the authors to leverage shared KV cache structures to accelerate inference.', 'efficiency while leveraging the large model’s strength when most needed.\\na more accurate thinking step. The larger model then generates the next thought segment\\nin place of the smaller model, effectively acting as a reasoning supervisor or corrector. This\\nlarge-model-aided intervention may enhance the robustness and accuracy of smaller models\\nby injecting stronger reasoning capabilities, thus balancing efficiency and performance.\\n3 Method: Speculative Thinking\\nWe propose a collaborative inference framework termed Speculative Thinking, where a\\nsmall model acts as speculative model and a large model serves as target model. Speculative\\nmodel performs primary reasoning, while target model intervenes selectively to provide\\nauxiliary thoughts when necessary. The overall framework is in Figure 4, . Target model\\ntakes over speculative model’s generation under the following three scenarios. The hyper-\\nparameters for Speculative Thinking—such as the selection of Reflection and Affirmation. Document Meaning : The fourth section, \"4 Experiments,\" focuses on the evaluation of Speculative Thinking. The authors adopted three key evaluation metrics: accuracy, average output length, and estimated inference speed. The rationale for choosing the estimated inference speed and the details of its computation are provided at the end of this section. Experiments were conducted on four benchmark datasets: AIME 2022–2024, GPQA-Diamond, MATH500, and AMC23.', 'In summary, Speculative Thinking offers a new inference-time paradigm that fuses the\\nefficiency of small models with the reasoning strength of large models. It opens a promising\\npath toward cost-effective reasoning augmentation for real-world inference.\\n2 Motivations\\n2.1 Analysis of LLM Reasoning Process\\nThis section investigates characteristic patterns that commonly emerge during the reasoning\\nprocesses of current reasoning models. By analyzing these patterns, we aim to uncover\\npotential avenues for enhancing and optimizing the models’ reasoning capabilities.\\n“\\\\n\\\\n” acts as a structural clue in model reasoning process. During inference, reasoning\\nmodels frequently generate certain reasoning-supportive tokens such as “wait”, “hmm” and\\n“alternatively”, which are relative with the model’s self-reflection behavior. To further ana-\\nlyze them, we examine the preceding token distribution for reasoning-supportive tokens in.
